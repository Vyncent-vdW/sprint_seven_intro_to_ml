This project places us in the role of developing a model that analyzes subscribers' behavior for the telecommunications company Megaline. This model will recommend one of their newer plans: Smart or Ultra. 

We have access to behavior data about subscribers who have already switched to the new plans (from the project for the Statistical Data Analysis sprint). For this classification task, we need to develop a model that will pick the right plan. Since weâ€™ve already performed the data preprocessing step, we can move straight to creating the model.
