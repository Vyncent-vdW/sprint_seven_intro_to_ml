# üìò Megaline Subscriber Behavior Analysis
This project is part of TripleTen's Data Science program and focuses on analyzing subscriber behavior using supervised machine learning techniques. The goal is to predict customer churn, support strategic decision-making in the telecom sector, and optimize marketing efforts.

## üöÄ Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing subscriber data for analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Identifying trends, patterns, and correlations in the dataset.
- **Feature Engineering**: Creating and selecting features to improve model performance.
- **Model Training and Evaluation**: Training classification models and evaluating them using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- **Model Comparison**: Comparing models such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest to identify the best-performing approach.
- **Business Insights**: Delivering actionable insights to reduce churn and improve customer retention.

## üì¶ Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Vyncent-vdW/sprint_seven_intro_to_ml.git

# Navigate into the project directory
cd sprint_seven_intro_to_ml

# (Optional) Create and activate a virtual environment
